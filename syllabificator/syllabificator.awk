#
# Script that separates words into syllables for Portuguese language.
#
# Usage:
#     # produces: in.cons.ti.tu.ci.o.nal.men.te
#     echo inconstitucionalmente | awk -f syllabificator.awk
#
#     # split all words from a Linux dictionary
#     awk -f syllabificator.awk /usr/share/dict/brazilian
#
# This script puts <ss> and <rr> in the same syllable, for simplicity of the transcriber rules.
#
# If you need separate <ss> and <rr> in different syllables, use the flag `-v ORTHOGRAPHICALLY_CORRECT=1`.
#
# If you are looking for a syllabificator for another other language, this script will probably fail miserably.
#
# Although this script splits a few words wrongly, such as "continuidade" and "intuição," its success rate far outweighs its failures.
